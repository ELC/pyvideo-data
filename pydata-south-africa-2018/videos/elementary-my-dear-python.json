  "description": "Erin Versfeld\n\nhttps://2018.za.pycon.org/talks/72-elementary-my-dear-python/\n\nSherlock is a diagnostics framework used to assess fleet health within Oracle Public Cloud. It is developed in Python, and operates within a restricted Python environment, but has been designed to overcome the challenges of our enterprise environment.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of the restricted Python environment in which Sherlock operates and discuss how Sherlock has leveraged features of Python to maintain its independence. It will highlight the design challenges that were faced to ensure that the framework could be robust and lightweight. As part of the talk, I will showcase how we've utilised Python's strengths to provide a framework which easily allows developers from vastly different teams to write diagnostic scripts to easily asses service health across a global fleet.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
