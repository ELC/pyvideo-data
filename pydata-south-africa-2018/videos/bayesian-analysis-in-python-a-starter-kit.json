  "description": "Andrew Collier\n\nhttps://2018.za.pycon.org/talks/5-bayesian-analysis-in-python-a-starter-kit/\n\nBayesian techniques present a compelling alternative to the frequentist view of statistics, providing a flexible approach to extracting a swathe of meaningful information from your data. The learning curve is somewhat steep, but the benefits of adding Bayesian techniques to your tool suite are enormous!\r\n\r\nWhat are the bare essentials that you need to know to start applying Bayesian techniques? This talk will provide an entry level discussion covering the following topics:\r\n\r\n\u2039ul\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aWhat can Bayes do for me? (A brief introduction to Bayesian methods)\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aUnderstanding Markov Chain Monte Carlo. (MCMC is what happens behind the scenes)\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aWhat is Stan? (Writing models in Stan)\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aUsing Stan in Python. (The PyStan package)\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039/ul\u203a\r\n\r\nThe talk will be peppered with useful tips for dealing with the initial challenges of using Stan with Python.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
