  "description": "Richard Ackon\n\nhttps://2018.za.pycon.org/talks/48-reproducible-data-science-with-docker/\n\nCollaboration is a major part of doing Data Science. This means Data Scientists are always sharing their work with their colleagues whether to continue in the Data Science process or for review. One problem that is mostly faced in this process is the \"It works on my machine\" problem. \n\nDocker is a tool that is used to package and run applications with all their dependencies in an isolated environment. \n\nIn this talk, I'll use Python to analyse some data in jupyter notebooks and show how Docker can be used to ensure reproducibility of that analysis in a different environment.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\u2039ul\u203a\n\u2039li\u203aThe basics of the data science workflow\u2039/li\u203a\n\u2039li\u203aThe basics of Docker\u2039/li\u203a\n\u2039li\u203aA demonstration of sharing and reproducing data analysis work in a jupyter notebook.\u2039/li\u203a\n\u2039/ul\u203a\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
