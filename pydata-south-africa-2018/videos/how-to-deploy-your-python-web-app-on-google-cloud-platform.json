After that, we will show how to provision a Linux VM on Google Cloud to run a python web app. We will then explore how to package our Python web app into a docker image and deploy the same on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Finally, we will explore Google Cloud Functions and how to write a serverless app in Python. \r\n\r\nThe audience for this talk is generally Python web developers and devops engineers.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
