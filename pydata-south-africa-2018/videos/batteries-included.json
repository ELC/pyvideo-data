It\u2019s so easy to install and import a third-party package that we end up forgetting how vast and valuable the Python Standard Library is. In this talk I\u2019ll be exploring the default Python ecosystem, the one that does not need a pip install to be used. From collections to bisect, everyone from with any Python knowledge is welcome to have some fun and learn about the tools you already have in your toolbelt.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
