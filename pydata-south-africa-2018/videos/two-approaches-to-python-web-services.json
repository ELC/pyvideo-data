  "description": "Kenneth Goldswain, Matthew French\n\nhttps://2018.za.pycon.org/talks/70-two-approaches-to-python-web-services/\n\nWe discuss two different approaches to building web services using Python. The first and more traditional approach uses Flask to build a web service, while the second approach builds a web service using only native Python 2.7 libraries without dependencies on any additional software.\r\n\r\nThe talk starts by discussing web services in general before moving onto the different environments our services run in, and what they will be used for. We will briefly cover the code used, but the focus will be on the reason why we need two different approaches and we will compare the risks and benefits of using these two contrasting methods. \r\n\r\nWe hope the talk will inspire people to experiment even further with web services, or at least give them insight into new ways they could use web services.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
