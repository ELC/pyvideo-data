  "description": "Bruce Merry\n\nhttps://2018.za.pycon.org/talks/27-an-introduction-to-concurrent-programming-with-asyncio/\n\nConcurrent programming is useful any time one needs to deal with multiple concurrent tasks: a server answering requests from multiple clients, a client scraping data from multiple servers, a workflow manager running external processes in a pipeline, and more.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many concurrent programming frameworks for Python, there is one that is included out of the box: asyncio. I will introduce the framework and explain the syntax and APIs. Perhaps more importantly, I will offer practical tips on development with asyncio, such as exception handling, testing, debugging, and integration with existing code.\r\n\r\nAttendees will come away with an understanding of why they will want to use asyncio instead of multi-threading, an understanding of the basic concepts, and knowledge of some additional libraries that will help them be productive with asyncio.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
