She had already asked her classmates on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was able to help as all her peers had the same limited resources available to them. This gave me the idea for Buza (Zulu for \u201cask\u201d), a platform for high school learners to ask questions that could be answered by volunteer university students in their free time.\r\n\r\nBuza is the first side project of mine that I\u2019ve ever truly wanted to deploy. After months of coding and adding loads of features, I finally reached out to a senior developer to help me deploy my truck of features. The first thing she said was \u201cA lot of this code will have to be replaced with production-ready code\u201d. These are words you never want to hear.\r\n\r\nUniversity Computer Science equipped me with the ability to write code to solve problems, but in industry extra skills were required to build production-ready software. This talk will share the valuable lessons I learned from getting this Django web app production-ready. This will start with how to c\u2039strong\u203ahoose the right tools, framework, environment for your project\u2039/strong\u203a. I will also cover how to set up \u2039strong\u203atesting and continuous integration for your project\u2039/strong\u203a.\r\n\r\n\u2039em\u203aWhat I will cover (Zero to Hero):\u2039/em\u203a\r\n\u2039ul\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aNo code is the best code\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aFramework: DJango\u2039/li\u203a \r\n    \u2039li\u203aEnvironment: Pipenv\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aStatic Tests: Flake8, Mypy (checks types), isort(sorts imports)\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aTest Driven Development\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aAutomated testing: Tox and Travis\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203aCode Coverage\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039/ul\u203a\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
