While this speaks to a larger problem of upskilling and making education more accessible, one method of translation is through story telling. \r\n\r\nI learn best when an \u2039strong\u203aidea is relatable, simple, and colourful\u2039/strong\u203a. This talk is going to look at how to convey complex ideas simply.  I'm going to be covering two sections: \r\n\r\n\u2039ul\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203a1. That's So Random (Forests)!\u2039/li\u203a\r\n    \u2039li\u203a2. You Gotta (Neural) Network to Get Work\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039/ul\u203a\r\n\r\nI'll run through the high level concepts and methodologies, and then show the work/code that was done to create a random forest, and a neural network. Note: this will cover how I built the RF, and NN using Python via Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\nThis session is for anyone who uses/wants to use ML to solve problems but struggles with translating the black-box-magic. \r\nIt's going to be an engaging, and slightly animated, talk with the intention of reinforcing concepts and showcasing different ways of explaining them.\n\npyconza2018\n\npython",
