Maybe because the framework was chosen for us, maybe it's the one available at hand, maybe that's the skill most prevalent in the team, maybe it was chosen by following a decision analysis process, maybe other vagaries of the workplace were in play.\n\nThis is incredibly limiting in developing an intuition for problem solving, exploring the possibilities and simply being able to use the right tool for the right job.\n\nIn trying to gain experience on a new framework on our own, we are inundated with myriad concepts, jargon and \"technical evangelism\" so much that getting to the practical stuff often becomes an uphill battle for most of us.\n\nThis workshop aims to address this fundamental issue:\n1. Get hands-on experience across some of the most in-demand data engineering frameworks around today - Pandas, Spark, Dask, Polars etc.\n2. Focus on the one core thing - data munging - shaping data, analyzing it and deriving insights.\n\nIn this interactive 2-hour workshop, fellow data engineers will explore and gain practical experience with some of the industry's most sought-after data engineering frameworks. Through a series of engaging exercises and real-world-like examples, fellow attendees will be empowered to tackle data engineering challenges efficiently and effectively.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
