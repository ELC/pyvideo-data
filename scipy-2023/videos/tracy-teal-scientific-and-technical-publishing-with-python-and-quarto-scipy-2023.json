  "description": "In research and data science, effective communication requires weaving together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. By embedding executable Python code blocks inside markdown, the open-source publishing platform, Quarto, works with Jupyter and VS Code to enable you to create these fully reproducible documents and reports with the format and styling you need. In this talk Iâ€™ll share how to get started and a few of my favorite things in Quarto including creating a manuscript, presentation and website in HTML, PDF and Word from a single source file, and creating lessons, reports, and Confluence documents.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
