  "description": "Communities are at the heart of open source software and are fundamental to our projects\u2019 long-term success. The Python ecosystem has several mature projects, that have spent years working on community initiatives. Newer projects can learn from their experiences and build stronger foundations to foster healthy communities.\n\nIn this talk, we share a set of practices for community-first projects, including repository management, contributor pathways, and governance principles. We\u2019ll also share real examples from our own journey transitioning a company-backed OSS project, Nebari (https://nebari.dev/), to be more community-oriented.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
