  "description": "Qiskit is an open-source SDK for quantum computers, enabling developers to work with these powerful machines using a familiar python interface. First released in 2017, Qiskit has become the most popular package for quantum computing (Unitary Fund, 2022), with a thriving open-source community. As Qiskit has grown and changed, so has our approach to nurturing our community. This talk will share important lessons we’ve learnt over the years, including practical tips you can apply to your own projects. Whether you’re just starting in open-source or already manage an established community, this talk is for you!\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
