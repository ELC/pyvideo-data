  "description": "Jupyter-scatter is a scalable, interactive, and interlinked scatter plot widget for exploring datasets with up to several million data points. It focuses on data-driven visual encodings and offers two-way pan+zoom and lasso interactions. Beyond a single instance, jupyter-scatter can compose multiple scatter plots and synchronize their views and selections. Moreover, points can be connected by spline-interpolated lines. Thanks to the underlying WebGL rendering engine, spatial and color changes are smoothly transitioned. Finally, the API integrates seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames and offers functional methods that group properties by type to ease accessibility and readability.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
