  "description": "This talk will discuss how Numba was used to accelerate MCViNE, a software environment for building and running digital twins of neutron experiments via Monte Carlo ray tracing. Numba is an open-source JIT compiler for Python using LLVM to generate efficient machine code for CPUs and GPUs with NVIDIA CUDA. Python and Numba were used to create a GPU accelerated version of MCViNE utilizing an extensible object-oriented design that has achieved a speedup of up to 1000x over the CPU. The performance gain with Numba enables more sophisticated data analysis and impacts neutron scattering science and instrument design.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
