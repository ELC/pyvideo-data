  "description": "napari is an n-dimensional image viewer for Python. If you\u2019ve ever tried plt.imshow(arr) and made Matplotlib unhappy because arr has more than two dimensions, then napari might be for you! napari will gladly display higher-dimensional arrays by providing sliders to explore additional dimensions. But napari can also: overlay derived data, such as points, segmentations, polygons, surfaces, and more; and annotate and edit these data, using standard data structures like NumPy or Zarr arrays, allowing you to seamlessly weave exploration, computation, and annotation in image analysis.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
