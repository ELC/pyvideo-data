  "description": "In the era of exascale computing, storage and analysis of large scale data have become more important and difficult. We present libyt, an open source C++ library, that allows researchers to analyze and visualize data using yt or other Python packages in parallel during simulation runtime. We describe the methods for reading adaptive mesh refinement data structure, handling data transition between Python and simulation with minimal memory overhead, and conducting analysis with no additional time penalty using Python C API and NumPy C API. We demonstrate how it solves the problem in astrophysical simulations and increases disk usage efficiency.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
