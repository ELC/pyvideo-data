  "description": "Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives often start with measurement - what do our communities look like today and how can we track progress against our goals? However, data collected through APIs, web scraping, surveys, interviews, inference etc. have the potential to expose more details about an individual than they were expecting, especially when aggregated across platforms and shared in public forums. This talk will discuss tactics, opportunities and challenges when collecting sensitive data in and around open source communities, while aligning with policies and regulations, respecting the right to anonymity and ensuring the safety of all members of the community.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
