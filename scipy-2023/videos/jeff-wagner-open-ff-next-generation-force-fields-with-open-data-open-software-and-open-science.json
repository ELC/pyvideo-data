  "description": "The Open Force Field (OpenFF) initiative was formed to build a new generation of force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using modern data-driven techniques. Openness is one of our fundamental founding principles, and everything we produce is released openly and accessibly so that the community can validate, modify, or extend our work. Here we introduce some flagship packages in our ecosystem and the advances they have enabled in force field science and MD workflows. These include fitting custom functional forms, exploring the addition of off-site charges, and using neural networks to assign charges to protein-ligand systems.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
