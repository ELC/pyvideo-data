  "description": "A key feature of the Python data ecosystem is the reliance on simple but efficient primitives that follow well-defined interfaces to make tools work seamlessly together (Cf. http://data-apis.org/). NumPy provides an in-memory representation for tensors. Dask provides parallelisation of tensor access. Xarray provides metadata linking tensor dimensions. Zarr provides a missing feature, namely the scalable, persistent storage for annotated hierarchies of tensors. Defined through a community process, the Zarr specification enables the storage of large out-of-memory datasets locally and in the cloud. Implementations exist in C++, C, Java, Javascript, Julia, and Python, enabling.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
