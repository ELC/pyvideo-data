  "description": "MetPy is an open-source Python package for meteorological and atmospheric science applications, leveraging significantly many other pieces of the scientific Python stack (e.g. numpy, matplotlib, scipy, etc.). With a focus on sustainability, Metpy extensively leverages GitHub Action to try to automate as much of the software development process as possible. Sustainability also extends to the growth of the community of developers, and we have been working to try to make that sustainable as well. Here we talk about our experiences, share our successes and lessons learned with trying to build a sustainable project.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
