  "description": "The open-source project, Xarray, combines labeled data structures inspired by Pandas with NumPy-like multi-dimensional arrays to provide an intuitive and scalable interface for scientific analysis. Xarray has strong user bases in the physical sciences and geospatial community. However, new users commonly struggle to fit their dataset into the Xarray model and with conceptualizing and constructing an Xarray object that makes subsequent analysis steps easy (\u201cdataset wrangling\u201d). We take inspiration from the \u201ctidy data\u201d concept for dataframes \u2014 \u201cdatasets structured to facilitate analysis\u201d (Wickham, 2014) \u2014 and attempt a definition of tidy data for labeled array objects provided by Xarray.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
