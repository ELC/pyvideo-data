  "description": "Emukit is an open-source package for uncertainty quantification in Python. It provides various Bayesian methods, such as optimization, experimental design and quadrature, in a flexible unified way that leverages their commonalities. In the talk we will explain how and why Emukit was built, what are its strengths and weaknesses, how it is used today and in what scenarios one might find it useful.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
