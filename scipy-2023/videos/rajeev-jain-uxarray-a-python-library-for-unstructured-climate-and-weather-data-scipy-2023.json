  "description": "UXarray aims to provide xarray-styled functionality for unstructured grid datasets. UXarray offers support for loading and representing unstructured grids by utilizing existing Xarray functionality paired with new routines that are specifically written for operating on unstructured grids. In this talk, we will present the current capabilities of the library: reading and writing of unstructured grids, reading of datasets along with basic grid operations and the need to speed up computations, integration operations along with details on speedups obtained by using Numba and python indexing. We will also demonstrate the use of this library for visualization of unstructured grids.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development.
