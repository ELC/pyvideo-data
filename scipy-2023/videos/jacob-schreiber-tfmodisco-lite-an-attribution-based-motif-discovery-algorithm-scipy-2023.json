  "description": "An important problem in genomics is identifying the proteins that bind to DNA. Although many methods attempt to learn DNA motifs underlying protein binding as position-weight matrices (PWMs), these PWMs cannot faithfully represent real biology. For instance, a static PWM cannot describe a zinc-finger protein whose fingers can optionally include one-nucleotide spacing. TF-MoDISco is a framework for extracting motifs using attribution scores from a machine-learning model. The learned motifs and syntax overcome many of the limitations presented by PWM. I will describe the TF-MoDISco algorithm and showcase its efficient re-implementation, tfmodisco-lite.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
