  "description": "Behind every successful open source project is a strong contributor community. What makes these communities strong? What can you do in your OSS project to nurture a thriving contributor community? In this presentation, we will share insights from the work of the Contributor Experience Lead team (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas) and discuss why designing and providing positive contributor experience is vital to sustainability of each individual project and the SciPy ecosystem overall.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
