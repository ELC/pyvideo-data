  "description": "Geolocated data from smartphone apps are well-established resources for research. While most of that data come as points (e.g., geotagged photos), there are a growing number of apps that collect linear data from users activities (e.g., running, hiking, off-road driving). Using established ecological methods, shallow-machine learning packages, and multiprocessing we demonstrate a novel approach using mobile app data to estimate back-country recreation popularity at multiple scales. The topics covered include normalizing and thinning coordinate data, merging linear data from multiple sources, and accounting for spatial bias while preserving the integrity of the original data.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
