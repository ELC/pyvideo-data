  "description": "This tutorial is an introduction to cloud-based geospatial analysis with Earth Engine and the geemap Python package. We will cover the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment using geemap. We will also demonstrate how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps. Throughout the session, practical examples and hands-on exercises will be provided to enhance learning. The attendees should have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not required, but will be useful.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
