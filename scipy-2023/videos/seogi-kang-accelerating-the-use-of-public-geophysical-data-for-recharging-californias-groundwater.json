  "description": "Recharging ground aquifers is an urgent task for improving groundwater sustainability in California. Geophysical data can provide a capability to image the subsurface where the major data gap lies. However, neither data nor analytic tools required to derive subsurface information is readily accessible. We present an interactive web application that utilizes a public database, GIS capabilities and directly integrates Jupyter Notebooks and Python packages from researchers to guide recharge site location. Our demonstration showcases how this technology can contribute to improving groundwater recharge in California and how integrating the research knowledge directly into a web application can increase the impact.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
