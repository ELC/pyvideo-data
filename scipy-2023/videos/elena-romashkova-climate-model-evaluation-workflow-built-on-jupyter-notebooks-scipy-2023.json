  "description": "This project introduces an extensible workflow used to evaluate climate model output using collections of Jupyter notebooks. The workflow supports parametrizing and batch-executing notebooks using Papermill, in conjunction with developing notebooks interactively. Additional features include integration with Dask and caching intermediate data products generated by notebooks. The final product of the workflow can automatically be built into a Jupyter book for easy presentation and shareability. While it was initially developed for climate modeling, the flexible and extensible nature of this framework makes it adaptable to any kind of data analysis work, and the presentation will highlight this capability.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
