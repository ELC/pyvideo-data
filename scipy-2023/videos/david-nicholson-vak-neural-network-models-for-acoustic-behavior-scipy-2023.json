  "description": "Research on animal acoustic communication is being revolutionized by deep learning. In this talk we present vak, a framework that allows researchers in this area to easily benchmark deep neural network models and apply them to their own data. We'll demonstrate how research groups are using vak through examples with TweetyNet, a model that automates annotation of birdsong by segmenting spectrograms. Then we'll show how adopting Lightning as a backend in version 1.0 has allowed us to incorporate more models and features, building on the foundation we put in place with help from the scientific Python stack.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development.
