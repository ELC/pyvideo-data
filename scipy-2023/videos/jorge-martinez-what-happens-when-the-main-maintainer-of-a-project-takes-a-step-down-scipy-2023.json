  "description": "Once a maintainer of a project decides to step down of a project, the community needs to quickly adapt to this decision. This situation can be devastating for small projects and lead to their extinction. This talk demonstrates, based on the case of poliastro, that the community is a key factor for a software to survive no matter who is leading it.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
