  "description": "Taking scikit-learn models to production or hosting them openly has it's own challenges, like reproducibility, safety and more. We are trying to tackle these problems with our new open-source library skops. skops provides easy APIs to host your models, automatically create widgets for inference and create model cards that documents the model for versioning. In this talk, I will walk you through how you can use skops and Hugging Face Hub for versioning models.",
