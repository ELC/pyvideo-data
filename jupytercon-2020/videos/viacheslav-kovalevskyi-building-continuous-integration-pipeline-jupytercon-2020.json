  "description": "Brief Summary\nIt is a common belief that Jupyter Notebooks and production are non compatible. This leads to a several consequence: * Almost no models see light of prod * Even for the most valuable models it takes weeks and weeks to deliver even simpler model to the prod We do believe that this can be drastically improved by providing a way of using Notebooks directly in the production\n\nOutline\nWhat you will learn: * How to make your Notebooks self-contained * How to build CI system around self contained notebooks * How to improve collaboration between teams with self-contained notebooks * How to deploy artifacts produce by self contained notebooks to the prod automatically What we expect from you: * You should know what notebooks are * You should have some experience in working with Notebooks and deploying to the production environment\n----\nJupyterCon brings together data scientists, business analysts, researchers, educators, developers, core Project\u00a0contributors, and tool creators for in-depth training, insightful keynotes, networking, and practical talks exploring\u00a0the Project Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/\u00a0\n\nJupyterCon is possible thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, and the labor of many volunteer organizers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/sponsors/\u00a0\nhttps://jupytercon.com/about/#Organizing%20Committee\u00a0(edited)\u00a0\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020",
