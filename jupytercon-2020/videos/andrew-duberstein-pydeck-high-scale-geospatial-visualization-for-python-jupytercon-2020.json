  "description": "Brief Summary\nWith social graphs, genomics, and sensor data visualizations, data scientists often need to render massive spatial data sets. In 2018, Uber released pydeck, an open source Python library for rendering beautiful high scale data visualizations, built on top of Uber's deck.gl library. We'll go over how pydeck was written and how to use pydeck to visualize large-scale data sets. See more at pydeck.gl.\n\nOutline\nAfter this talk, you'll know what your options are for mapping geospatial data, what pydeck is, and how its Jupyter integration works. Attendees are expected to know Python scripting, Pandas, and Jupyter. Ideal attendees have experience in data science, data analytics, or machine learning engineering, and have a passion for geospatial data.\n----\nJupyterCon brings together data scientists, business analysts, researchers, educators, developers, core Project\u00a0contributors, and tool creators for in-depth training, insightful keynotes, networking, and practical talks exploring\u00a0the Project Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/\u00a0\n\nJupyterCon is possible thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, and the labor of many volunteer organizers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/sponsors/\u00a0\nhttps://jupytercon.com/about/#Organizing%20Committee\u00a0(edited)\u00a0\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020",
