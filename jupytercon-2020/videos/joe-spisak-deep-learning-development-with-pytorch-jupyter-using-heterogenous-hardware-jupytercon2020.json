  "description": "Brief Summary\nPyTorch + Jupyter provides an interactive and engaging way to do deep learning development. Additionally, heterogenous hardware, such as Cloud TPUs, continue to permeate the ecosystem and become more easily accessible to the developer community. In this talk, Joe Spisak - PyTorch Product Lead, will walk you through the process of building machine learning models with PyTorch in Jupyter.\n\nOutline\nIntro to PyTorch - what it is, who uses it, why it has such an amazing community and how we use Jupyter!\nDeveloping a model with Jupyter on Colab - data handling, model development and training and visualizing loss curves using TensorBoard, model evaluation.\nInterpreting the model with Captum and understanding what is attributing to the predictions\nBenchmarking different hardware backends using CPUs, GPUs and Cloud TPUs\n----\nJupyterCon brings together data scientists, business analysts, researchers, educators, developers, core Project\u00a0contributors, and tool creators for in-depth training, insightful keynotes, networking, and practical talks exploring\u00a0the Project Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/\u00a0\n\nJupyterCon is possible thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, and the labor of many volunteer organizers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/sponsors/\u00a0\nhttps://jupytercon.com/about/#Organizing%20Committee\u00a0(edited)\u00a0\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020\n\n\ufffc\njupytercon.com\nJupyterCon2020\nJupyterCon 2020",
