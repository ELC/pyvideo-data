  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/EXVUBJ/\n\nImagine a world where there are tools allowing any researcher to easily produce high quality scientific websites. Where it's trivial to include rich interactive figures that connect to Jupyter servers or run in-browser with WASM & pyodide, all from a local folder of markdown files and Jupyter notebooks.\n\nWe introduce MyST Markdown (https://mystmd.org/), a set of open-source, community-driven tools designed for open scientific communication.\n\nIt's a powerful authoring framework that supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, preprints, reports and journals articles. It includes thebe a minimal connector library for Jupyter, and thebe-lite that bundles a JupyterLite server with pyodide into any web page for in-browser python. It also provides publication-ready tex and pdf generation from the same content base, minimising the rework of publishing to the web and traditional services.",
