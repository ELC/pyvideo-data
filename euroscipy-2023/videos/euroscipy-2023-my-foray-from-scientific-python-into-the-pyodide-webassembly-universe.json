  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/Q9F8GA/\n\nPyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly / Emscripten.\nPyodide supports most commonly used scientific Python packages, like numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and there is growing interest to use it for improving package documentation through interactivity.\n\nIn this talk we will describe the work we have done in the past nine months to improve the state of Pyodide in a scientific Python context, namely:\n- running the scikit-learn and scipy test suites with Node.js to get a view of what currently works, what does not, and what can be hopefully be fixed one day\n- packaging OpenBLAS in Pyodide and use it for Pyodide scipy package to improve its stability, maintainability and performance\n- adding JupyterLite functionality to sphinx-gallery, which is used for example galleries of popular scientific Python package like scikit-learn, matplotlib, scikit-image, etc ...\n- adding the sphinx-gallery Jupyterlite functionality for scikit-learn example gallery\n\nWe will also mention some of the Pyodide sharp bits and conclude with some of the ideas we have to use it even more widely.",
