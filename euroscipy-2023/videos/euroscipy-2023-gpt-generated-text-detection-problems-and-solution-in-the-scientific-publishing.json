  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/YP9N8H/\n\nSince its release, ChatGPT is now widely adopted as \"the\" text generation tool used across all industries and businesses. This also includes the domain of scientific research where we do observe more and more scientific papers partially or even fully generated by AI. The same also applies to the peer-reviews reports created while reviewing a paper.\n\nWhat are the guidelines in the scientific research world? What is now the meaning of the written word and how do we build a model that can identify whether a text is AI-generated? What are the potential solutions to solve this important issue?\n\nWithin this talk, we are discussing on how to detect AI-generated text and how to create a scalable architecture integrating this tool.",
