It is particularly suited to solving difficult nonlinear estimation problems. On top, it provides functionality to perform statistical inference on estimated parameters.\n\nIn this presentation, we give a tour through estimagic's most notable features and explain its position in the ecosystem of Python libraries for numerical optimization.",
