It probably speaks SQL, because SQL is ubiquitous, it\u2019s been around for a while, it\u2019s standardized, and it\u2019s concise.\nBut is it really standardized? And is it always concise? No!\n\nDo we still need to use it? Probably!\n\nWhat\u2019s a data-person to do?

It offers a dataframe-like interface to construct concise and composable queries and then executes them against a wide variety of backends (Postgres, DuckDB, Spark, Snowflake, BigQuery, you name it.).",
