  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/BYFB3Y/\n\nWe love to use Python in our day jobs, but that enterprise database you run your ETL job against may have other ideas. It probably speaks SQL, because SQL is ubiquitous, it’s been around for a while, it’s standardized, and it’s concise.\nBut is it really standardized? And is it always concise? No!\n\nDo we still need to use it? Probably!\n\nWhat’s a data-person to do? String-templated SQL?\nprint(f”That way lies {{ m̴͕̰̻̏́ͅa̸̟̜͉͑d̵̨̫̑n̵̖̲̒͑̾e̸̘̼̭͌s̵͇̖̜̽s̸̢̲̖͗͌̏̊͜ }}”.)\n\nInstead, come and learn about Ibis! It offers a dataframe-like interface to construct concise and composable queries and then executes them against a wide variety of backends (Postgres, DuckDB, Spark, Snowflake, BigQuery, you name it.).",
