  "description": "MLOps encapsulates the discipline of \u2013 and infrastructure that supports \u2013 building and maintaining machine learning models in production. This talk highlights four challenges in carrying this out effectively: data quality, reproducibility, recoverability, and auditability. You\u2019ll learn how Flyte, an open source data- and machine-learning-aware orchestration tool, is designed to overcome these challenges and how you can apply the higher-level ideas baked into Flyte to your work!",
