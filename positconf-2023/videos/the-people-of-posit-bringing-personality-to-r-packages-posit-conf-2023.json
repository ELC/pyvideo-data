  "description": "Presented by JP Flores and Sarah Parker\r\n\r\nThe R programming language offers the versatility to perform statistical analyses, create publication-ready plots, and render high-quality reports and presentations. Despite having this environment of indispensable tools, it can be daunting for a beginner-level programmer to get started. Luckily, the Posit community is one of a kind and values inclusivity, collaboration, and empathy. By putting a face to the R packages we use on a daily basis, we hope to make every programmer feel included and capable. We want to inspire attendees to create their own projects or packages, connect with others inside and outside of their field of expertise, and challenge themselves to learn something new, knowing the community is right there to support them.\r\n\r\nMaterials: http://www.sarmapar.com/people_of_posit/\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Lightning talks.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1165",
