  "description": "Presented by Laura DeCicco\r\n\r\nTen years ago, the first set of git commits was submitted to a new R software package repository \"dataRetrieval\" with the goal to provide an easy way for R users to retrieve U.S Geological Survey (USGS) water data. At that time, the perception within the USGS was the use of R was exclusive to an elite group of \"very serious scientists.\" Fast forward, we now find many newer USGS hires having a solid grasp of the language from the start along with the use of R in a wide variety of applications. \r\n \r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss my experiences maintaining the dataRetrieval package, how it's shaped my career, impacted USGS R usage, and why data providers should consider sponsoring their own R packages wrapping their data API services.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Lightning talks.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1171",
