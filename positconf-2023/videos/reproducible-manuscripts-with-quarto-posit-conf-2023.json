  "description": "Presented by Mine \u00c7etinkaya-Rundel\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a new capability in Quarto that provides a straightforward and user-friendly approach to creating truly reproducible manuscripts that are publication-ready for submission to popular journals. This new feature, Quarto manuscripts, includes the ability to produce a bundled output containing a standardized journal format, source documents, source computations, referenced resources, and execution information into a single bundle that is ingested into journal review and production processes. We'll demo how Quarto manuscripts work and how you can incorporate them into your current manuscript development process as well as touch on pain points in your current workflow that Quarto manuscripts help alleviate.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Quarto (1).\r\nSession Code: TALK-1070",
