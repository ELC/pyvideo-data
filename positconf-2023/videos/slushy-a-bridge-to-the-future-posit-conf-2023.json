  "description": "Presented by Becca Krouse\r\n\r\nScaling the use of R can present complications for environment management, especially in regulated industries with a focus on traceability. One solution is controlled (aka \"frozen\") environments, which are carefully curated and tested by tech teams. However, the speed of R development means the environments quickly become outdated and users are unable to benefit from the latest advances. Enter {slushy}: a team-friendly tool powered by {renv} and Posit Package Manager. Users can quickly mimic a controlled environment, with the easy ability to time travel between snapshot dates. Attendees will learn how {slushy} bolstered our R adoption efforts, and how this strategy enables tech teams and users to work in parallel towards a common future.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Managing packages.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1078",
