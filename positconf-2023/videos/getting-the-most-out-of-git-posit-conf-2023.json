  "description": "Presented by Colin Gillespie\r\n\r\nDid you believe that Git will solve all of your data science worries? Instead, you've been plunged HEAD~1 first into merging (or is that rebasing?) chaos. Issues are ignored, branches are everywhere, main never works, and no one really knows who owns the repository. \r\n\r\nDon't worry! There are ways to escape this pit of despair. Over the last few years, we've worked with many data science teams. During this time, we've spotted common patterns and also common pitfalls. While one size does not fit all, there are golden rules that should be followed. At the end of this talk, you'll understand the processes other data science teams implement to make Git work for them.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Getting %$!@ done: productive workflows for data science.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1091\n--------------------------\nThumbnail from happygitwithr.com, still from Heaven King video",
