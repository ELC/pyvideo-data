  "description": "Crank your Python best practices up to 11 with Reproducible Builds!\n\nThis talk will explore Reproducible Builds by highlighting issues identified in Python projects, from the simple to the seemingly inscrutible.\n\nReproducible Builds is basically the crazy idea that when you build something, and you build it again, you get the exact same thing... or even more important, if someone else builds it, they get the exact same thing too.\n\nThrough a few code examples demonstrating common problems folks will learn what to watch out for when coding and how to fix them once identified.\n\nSome of the useful tooling for diagnosing and troubleshooting reproducibility issues (diffoscope and reprotest)... just so happen to be written in Python! Will even show you how to use them... and maybe take a look inside.",
