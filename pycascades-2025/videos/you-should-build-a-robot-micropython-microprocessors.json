  "description": "Thinking about building a robot? You should! But don\u2019t know where to start? In this talk, we'll break down the barriers building your own robotic project using MicroPython and microprocessors. You'll learn what a robot is, why building one is fun (maybe even useful), and how to get started with the essential components. We'll cover microprocessors as the \"brain\" of your robot, LEDs for visual feedback, actuators for adding movement, and sensors for touch and light.\nWhether you're a complete beginner or have dabbled in electronics before, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to start building your own robotic projects.",
