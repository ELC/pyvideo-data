  "description": "Let\u2019s use Python to make fun and interactive web maps! In this talk, we'll explore two easy ways to create web maps using Python: Streamlit and PyScript. We'll build a web app that helps you find the perfect hiking trail in Washington state, and in the process, learn how to integrate geographic data, visualize it interactively, and deploy it to the web.\n\nEach tool offers a unique approach to building interactive maps. With Streamlit, you\u2019ll see how simple it is to set up a dashboard (that includes maps) with minimal code. Then, we\u2019ll dive into PyScript, which enables you to run Python directly in the browser, allowing you to create and deploy a web map without having Python installed.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you'll understand two straightforward methods to create and deploy web maps with Python, with practical examples you can begin using right away!",
