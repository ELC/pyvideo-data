It did, but in which direction? \n\nAfter running startups, working at startups, working on open source, working in government, Adrianna is now making waves doing tech at.. an aquarium. For the last 12 years, she has also been the cofounder of an Indian nonprofit that works to teach Scratch and Python programming skills to underprivileged children in Mumbai and Pune. \n\nAlong the way, she\u2019s learned a few things about what technology can and cannot do. She\u2019s now interested in what happens when computers happen to people, most just in computers alone. \n\nCome hear about her journey, and how she still hopes that computers can bring joy to people.\n\nSat Apr 26 10:15:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
