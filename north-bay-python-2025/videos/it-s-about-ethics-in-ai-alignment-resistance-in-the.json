AI alignment is shaping who gets to speak, what gets remembered and how truth is defined.\n\nApplication developers, not AI researchers, are the ones implementing these systems\u2014which means AI governance isn\u2019t just a policy problem; it\u2019s a codebase and product problem.\n\nThis talk deconstructs alignment through a lens of control:\n\n- How authoritarian data controls like constitutional classifiers and red-team RLHF training are damaging reasoning models.\n- The \"slippery slope\" of allowing these kinds of classifiers to find their way into human communications\n- Why AI alignment is not just about safety\u2014it\u2019s about deciding who gets to define epistemic reality.\n- How engineers can identify, challenge, and counteract AI-mediated censorship in the tools they build.\n\nIf alignment becomes invisible, it becomes unchallengeable. If practitioners don\u2019t resist now, AI won\u2019t just shape knowledge\u2014it will shape what can even be thought.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\u2714 Understand how alignment architectures are being adapted for human speech control.\n\u2714 Recognize when AI alignment becomes silent censorship.\n\u2714 Resist epistemic capture by designing systems that preserve interpretability and agency.\n\nSat Apr 26 14:15:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
