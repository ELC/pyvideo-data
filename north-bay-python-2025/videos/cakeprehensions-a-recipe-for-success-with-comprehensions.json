Whether you\u2019re just starting out with Python, or you\u2019ve been using it for a long time, I wouldn\u2019t blame you for steering clear of the strange \u201cthis for this in that\u201d syntax. But fear not; I will rescue you with cake!\n\nWe'll walk through for loops, and how comprehensions are their tasty cousins. We'll talk about the various comprehensions we have at our disposal, including dictionary comprehensions, and comprehensions with conditionals. And then, like a towering 3-tiered cake, we'll try our hand at nested comprehensions.\n\nThis talk will arm you with a mental anchor to fall back on every time you write a comprehension, regardless of how simple or complex. Over time\u2014if you use this recipe enough\u2014you won\u2019t even need to crack open the cookbook. We will ask\u2026\n\nWhat do we want? Cake!\nWhen do we want it? As we loop over this iterable!\n\nYou\u2019ll leave hungry for those confusing-looking Python treats\u2026 and cake.\n\nSat Apr 26 15:15:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
