Want to chat without any centralized ISP? How about setting up your own private Internet of Things network? Or maybe you just want to stay in touch in areas without cell signal. Mesh networking has you covered. In this talk, we'll cover the underlying LoRaWAN technology that's powering modern mesh networking, the advantages and limitations of current meshnet implementations, the simplest ways to get started, and how to write Python code that communicates over the mesh.\n\nSat Apr 26 11:20:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
