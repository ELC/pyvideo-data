Now into its 4th session, it helps grow the community and bridge the gap between new contributors and long-time maintainers, ensuring the web framework and its eco-system continues to thrive and adapt to changing needs.\n\nI will share my experiences and insights about Djangonaut Space as a new contributor and session organizer. Whether you\u2019re new to open source, or a long-time maintainer, or a community leader, a mentorship program can have many benefits for your community. Learn how you can get involved, or how you might borrow ideas to create a successful mentorship program for your community.\n\nSun Apr 27 11:20:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
