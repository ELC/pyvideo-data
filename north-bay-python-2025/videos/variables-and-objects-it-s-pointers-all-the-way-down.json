These two surprising facts have a *lot* of interesting consequences and are the reason behind many of Python's design decisions.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore the reference-like nature of Python's variables and objects, noting both the benefits and gotchas involved.\n\nAmong other ideas, we'll see that in Python:\n\n- The word \"change\" is ambiguous\n- Copying is usually explicit\n- Infinitely recursive data structures aren't a concern\n- And tuples aren't always immutable\n\nDuring the process, we'll poke at our own mental model of Python and we'll get a bit pedantic at times.\n\nJoin us to learn how in Python, it's pointers (or references, names, bindings, or aliases) all the way down.\n\nSun Apr 27 15:15:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
