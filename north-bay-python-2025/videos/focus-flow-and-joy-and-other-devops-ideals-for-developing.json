However, The last decade of software delivery has demonstrated that security, reliability, quality and speed are not zero-sum trade-offs. \n\nIn this talk we take a look at a payments platform team and how they navigated the red tape of PCI DSS to adopt DevOps principles and practices and how it helped them improve their security, software delivery and made maintaining and demonstrating compliance much easier.\n\nSat Apr 26 13:10:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
