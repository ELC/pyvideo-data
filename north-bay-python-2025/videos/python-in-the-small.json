According to the TIOBE index, it is more than 10% ahead of its closest competitor (C++). It is the 800 pound gorilla in the programming language world, used in some of the largest systems on the biggest networks in tech.\n\nBut all that success comes along with \u2026 overhead. In this talk I will discuss the ways that Python can scale back *down* to a smaller size along various axes, and the reasons why it needs to, if we want it to continue to survive.\n\nSun Apr 27 10:50:00 2025 at Reis River Ranch\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1",
