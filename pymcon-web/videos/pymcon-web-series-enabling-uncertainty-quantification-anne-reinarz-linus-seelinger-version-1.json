  "description": "Treating uncertainties is essential in the design of safe aircraft, medical decision making, and many other fields. UM-Bridge enables straightforward uncertainty quantification (UQ) on advanced models by removing technical barriers.\n\nComplex numerical models often consist of large code bases that are difficult to integrate with UQ packages such as PyMC, holding back many interesting applications. UM-Bridge is a universal interface for linking UQ and models, greatly accelerating development from prototype to high-performance computing.\n\nThis hands-on tutorial teaches participants how to build UQ applications using PyMC and UM-Bridge. We cover a range of practical exercises ranging from basic toy examples all the way to controlling parallelized models on a live cloud cluster. Beyond that, we encourage participants to bring their own methods and problems.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Check out the tutorial slides here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ccw1Qs0JiHTYKCDFJncaHPwJF2_n27xS/view?usp=sharing\nCode: https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/tutorial.html\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Get ready for a live Q&A session on the 29th Jan (at 15: 00 UTC) and 30th Jan (at 06: 30 UTC), where they will delve deeper into the topic and engage with your questions.\n\n\ud83d\udccc For more information, check out our discourse post and RSVP to the meetup event for a reminder.\n\ud83d\udd17 Register for the live Q&A session:\n1. 29th Jan at 7 am PST (3:00\u202fpm UTC)\ud83d\udc49 https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/298279180/\n2. 30th Jan at 12 pm IST (6:30\u202fam UTC)\ud83d\udc49 https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/298356399/\n\n\ud83d\udd17 PyMCon Website: https://pymcon.com/events/\n\ud83d\udc49 Discourse Post for more details and discussion: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/13583\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2 PyMCon is a community conference that shares the latest in statistical practices, tricks, and tips.
