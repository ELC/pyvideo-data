  "description": "Are you seriously interested in Bayesian statistics but find yourself relying on familiar frequentist tools when it comes time to present your data at a conference or in a manuscript? If this statement rings true, you are not alone, and this talk is for you! In this presentation, I will go over some new tools we\u2019ve developed to help make running Bayesian versions of some of the most common statistical tests used in the behavioral and neural sciences intuitive and transparent.\n\nDiscourse post:\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/pymcon-web-series-05-the-bayesian-statistics-toolbox-april-17th-2023-hyosub-kim/11845\n\nFor more events:\nhttps://pymcon.com/events/\n\n#bayesian #python",
