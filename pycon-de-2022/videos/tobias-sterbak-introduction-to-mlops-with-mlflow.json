  "description": "Speaker:: Tobias Sterbak\n\nTrack: General: Production\nMachine learning requires experimenting with different datasets, data preparation steps, and algorithms to build a model that maximizes some target metric. Once you have built a model, you also need to deploy it to a production system, monitor its performance, and continuously retrain it on new data and compare with alternative models. A possible solution to managing parts of this complexity is offered by **MLFlow**.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use MLflow to:\r\n\r\n- Set up a tracking server and a model repository.\r\n- Keep track of machine learning training and experiment results (parameters, metrics and artifacts) with **MLflow Tracking**.\r\n- Package the training code in a reusable and reproducible format with **MLFlow Projects**.\r\n-  Deploy the model into a HTTP server with **MLFlow Models** and keep track of it's state.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/DV8PJT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
