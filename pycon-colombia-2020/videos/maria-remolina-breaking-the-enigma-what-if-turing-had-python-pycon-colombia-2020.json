(Inglés)\n\n\nIn this talk I want to bring back all the cryptographic work done during the World War II regarding the deciphering of the nazi communication system. In particular, I will present a python re\ncreation of the Enigma machine used to encrypt messages during the war, but most importantly I will present a historically accurate python simulator of the Bombe machine used to crack this cipher. I want to present, with our current technology and architecture, how did the researchers at Bletchley Park engineered an electro\nmechanical device, key to end the war. And how by doing that, they contribute to setting the bases for the first computers. I am going to present the technical challenges and the human efforts involved in breaking a code such as Enigma, as well as the key flaws that doomed it. Finally, I will try to obtain a replica of the Enigma machine in order for the audience to experiment the cipher process and elements first hand.\n\n\nWe want to say thanks to all our sponsors who helped make the conference a huge success.\n\n\n Universidad EAFIT \n http://www.eafit.edu.co/\n\n Globant \n https://www.globant.com/\n\n Linode \n https://www.linode.com/\n\n Mercadolibre.com \n https://www.mercadolibre.com.co/\n\n monoku.com \n https://monoku.com/\n\n Playvox \n https://www.playvox.com/\n\n UruIT \n https://uruit.com/\n\n Elastic \n https://www.elastic.co/es/\n\n #The_Python_Software_Foundation \n https://www.python.org/\n\n Monadical \n https://monadical.com/\n\n Fluid Attacks \n https://fluidattacks.com/\n\n Swapps \n https://swapps.com/\n\n TributiOnline \n https://www.tributi.com/\n\n VanHack \n https://vanhack.com/\n\n Avanet \n http://avanet.org/\n\n Cafeto Software \n https://cafeto.co/\n\n OmniBnk \n https://omnibnk.com/\n\n AutonomicMind \n https://autonomicmind.com/\n\n #AIFund \n https://aifund.ai/  \n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycon\ncolombia/\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyconcolombia/\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co",
