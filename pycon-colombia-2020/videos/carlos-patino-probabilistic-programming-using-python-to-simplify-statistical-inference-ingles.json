However, machine learning models still struggle with a critical element: interpretability. In other words, it is difficult to tell why a machine learning model is making a particular prediction.\n\nAs an alternative to pure machine learning models, statistical inference is a field that provides interpretable models that also quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. Statistical inference can sometimes be challenging to perform, so probabilistic programming is a paradigm that seeks to perform statistical analyses using the tools of computer science. Notably, these computer science tools simplify conducting inference by providing intuitive and efficient implementations of statistical methods.\n\nThis talk is about leveraging probabilistic programming to perform statistical inference in a simplified way using Python. In particular, I will cover how to use PyMC3 and Pyro in examples that illustrate the importance of probabilistic programming to solve challenges in the current data\ndriven world.\n\n\nWe want to say thanks to all our sponsors who helped make the conference a huge success.\n\n\n Universidad EAFIT \n http://www.eafit.edu.co/\n\n Globant \n https://www.globant.com/\n\n Linode \n https://www.linode.com/\n\n Mercadolibre.com \n https://www.mercadolibre.com.co/\n\n monoku.com \n https://monoku.com/\n\n Playvox \n https://www.playvox.com/\n\n UruIT \n https://uruit.com/\n\n Elastic \n https://www.elastic.co/es/\n\n #The_Python_Software_Foundation \n https://www.python.org/\n\n Monadical \n https://monadical.com/\n\n Fluid Attacks \n https://fluidattacks.com/\n\n Swapps \n https://swapps.com/\n\n TributiOnline \n https://www.tributi.com/\n\n VanHack \n https://vanhack.com/\n\n Avanet \n http://avanet.org/\n\n Cafeto Software \n https://cafeto.co/\n\n OmniBnk \n https://omnibnk.com/\n\n AutonomicMind \n https://autonomicmind.com/\n\n #AIFund \n https://aifund.ai/  \n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycon\ncolombia/\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyconcolombia/\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co",
