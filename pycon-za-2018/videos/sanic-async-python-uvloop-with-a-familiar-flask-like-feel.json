  "description": "Sanic is born from an article and the premise that async await syntax should be combined with a familiar flask like feel. The blazing speed of uvloop is combined with a familiar flask-like API to create a framework with less blocking code and faster response times. This talk will cover the specifics of Sanic as well as my real world exercise of building a insurance API with expensive blocking network calls to legacy (and slow) insurance APIs and services. Also, I might have forgotten to mention the web framework has a mascot from the sanic meme.",
